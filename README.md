> Be sure to review [Access points restrictions and limitations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-points-restrictions-limitations.html) before considering for a use case.

## Feature Overview

* Access points are unique hostnames
* enforce distinct permissions and network controls for any request made through the access point.
* Customers with shared data sets scale access for hundreds of applications by creating individualized access points with names and permissions customized for each application.
* access point can be restricted to a VPC to firewall S3 data access within customers’ private networks
* AWS Service Control Policies can be used to ensure all access points are VPC restricted.
* no longer have to manage a single, complex bucket policy with hundreds of different permission rules that need to be written, read, tracked, and audited. With S3 Access Points, you can now create application-specific access points permitting access to shared data sets with policies tailored to the specific application.

## Example

### Policy

limit access to `partner-01` role

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllObjectActions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::529276214230:role/partner-01"
            },
            "Action": "s3:*Object",
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:us-east-1:529276214230:accesspoint/partner-01-read-write/object/*"]
        }
    ]
}
```

**Access Point Hostname**

<https://partner-01-read-write-529276214230.s3-accesspoint.us-east-1.amazonaws.com>

### Example Usage

```sh
# get `a.c` using `partner-01` role
aws --profile partner-01 s3api get-object --key a.c --bucket 'arn:aws:s3:us-east-1:529276214230:accesspoint/partner-01-read-write' -
